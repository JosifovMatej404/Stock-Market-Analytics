<h2>Project Description: System for Processing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Financial Data</h2>

This project aims to provide an integrated system for collecting, processing, storing, analyzing, and visualizing financial data. The system consists of five interconnected services, each with a specific role.

The Data Ingestion Service is responsible for gathering data from various financial sources, such as stock exchanges and APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage), using HTTP and WebSocket protocols.

The Real-Time Processing Service utilizes Apache Kafka and Apache Spark Streaming to process data in real time, including filtering, aggregation, and transformation.

The Data Storage Service ensures efficient data storage in distributed databases such as Cassandra for unstructured data and PostgreSQL for structured data.

The Data Analysis Service applies machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis to detect trends, generate predictions, and prepare reports based on historical and real-time data.

The Data Visualization Service provides a web interface for visualizing analyzed data using D3.js or Plotly, displaying graphs and tables to support better decision-making.

By integrating these services, the system will deliver a fast, scalable, and reliable solution for real-time financial analysis.
